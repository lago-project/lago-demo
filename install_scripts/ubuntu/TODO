Changes to lago code:
----------------------

1. add 'qemu-system-x86_64' to lago/vm line 234

Changes to rpm packaging
--------------------------

1. Find a solution for the creation of:
    /var/lib/lago
    /etc/lago.d


Others
--------

1. Write an install script for ubuntu - There are too many changes that need to be made
to the install script of el/fc (repos, install commands, names of groups and services).
I think that it will be better to write a separate install script.
